## Introduction
This project is a challenge on DAX Suggestion set up by the Microsoft Reactor Team. It is a Power BI project on Production and Work Order analysis of **Adventure Works 2019**. The project is to analyze and derive insights into Production performance by various categories and time period.

## Problem Statement
1. What is the Production over time?
2. What is the total revenue generated by products and their details over a period of time?
3. What are the top products ordered?
4. Which products required more costs?
5. What is the average hours spent per Production Line?

## Skills/Concepts Demonstrated
The following Power BI features were incorporated:
- DAX
- Quick measures
- Page navigation
- Modelling
- Filters
- Tooltips
- Button

## Data Sourcing
The link to the data source was provided by the team even though it had to go through SQL Server. I extracted the dataset from SQL server

AdventureWorks2019 database tables - Production.Product, Production.BillOfMaterials, Production.WorkOrder, and  Production.WorkOrderRouting.
